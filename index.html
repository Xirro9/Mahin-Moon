                <p>This website itself is one of my accomplishments</p>
                <p>I made this website entirely from scratch, leveraging online resources to master the <br> intricacies of HTML and CSS. Through dedicated self-teaching, I honed my skills to create an impressive digital presence. <br>From crafting the layout to fine-tuning the design elements, every aspect of this website reflects my commitment to excellence in all that I set my mind too.</p>
                <br>
                <p>tldr: I taught myself enough html to make this site in 3 hours and then made this portfolio in 20 or so hours</p>
